# Contributing

There are many ways to contribute to Able Player, and we welcome and appreciate your help! Here are some options:

## Pull Request Process

- If you spot bugs or have feature requests, please submit them to the [Issues][issues] queue.
- If you have code to contribute, please note that all development occurs on the [develop branch][develop]. This is often many commits ahead of the main branch, so please do all development from *develop*, and submit pull requests there.
- If you are multilingual, please consider translating Able Player into another language! All labels, prompts, messages, and help text for each language are contained within a single file, contained within the */translations* directory.

We particularly appreciate help with any issues in the Issues queue that have been flagged with "help wanted".

## Code of Conduct

All contributors to Able Player are expected to follow our [published Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).
